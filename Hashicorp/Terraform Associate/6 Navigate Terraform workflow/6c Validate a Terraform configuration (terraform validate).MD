## 6c Validate a Terraform configuration (terraform validate)

## Summary
The terraform validate command validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.

Validate runs checks that verify whether a configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent, regardless of any provided variables or existing state. It is thus primarily useful for general verification of reusable modules, including correctness of attribute names and value types.

It is safe to run this command automatically, for example as a post-save check in a text editor or as a test step for a re-usable module in a CI system.

Validation requires an initialized working directory with any referenced plugins and modules installed. To initialize a working directory for validation without accessing any configured remote backend, use:

```
$ terraform init -backend=false
```

## Usage

Usage: terraform validate [options]

This command accepts the following options:

* -json - Produce output in a machine-readable JSON format, suitable for use in text editor integrations and other automated systems. Always disables color.

* -no-color - If specified, output won't contain any color.
