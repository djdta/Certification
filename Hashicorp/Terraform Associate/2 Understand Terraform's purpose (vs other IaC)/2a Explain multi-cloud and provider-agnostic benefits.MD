# 2a Explain multi-cloud and provider-agnostic benefits

* CloudFormation from AWS
* Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates
* The support for the following cloud provider Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Googleâ€™s Cloud Platform (GCP).
* Terraform is agnostic
* It leverages providers the following VMware, Kubernetes, and MySQL
* Terraform has a multi-cloud and provider-agnostic approach that makes it ideal for use across multiple clouds and services.

Multi-Cloud Deployment
It's often attractive to spread infrastructure across multiple clouds to increase fault-tolerance. By using only a single region or cloud provider, fault tolerance is limited by the availability of that provider. Having a multi-cloud deployment allows for more graceful recovery of the loss of a region or entire provider.

Realizing multi-cloud deployments can be very challenging as many existing tools for infrastructure management are cloud-specific. Terraform is cloud-agnostic and allows a single configuration to be used to manage multiple providers, and to even handle cross-cloud dependencies. This simplifies management and orchestration, helping operators build large-scale multi-cloud infrastructures.

## Key Notes
Terraform has a multi-cloud and
provider-agnostic approach that makes it ideal for use across multiple clouds and services.
