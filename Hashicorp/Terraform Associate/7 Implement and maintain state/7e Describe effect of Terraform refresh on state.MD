## 7e 	Describe effect of Terraform refresh on state

## Summary
The terraform refresh command is used to reconcile the state Terraform knows about (via its state file) with the real-world infrastructure. This can be used to detect any drift from the last-known state, and to update the state file.

This does not modify infrastructure, but does modify the state file. If the state is changed, this may cause changes to occur during the next plan or apply.

## Usage
Usage: terraform refresh [options]

The terraform refresh command accepts the following options:

* -backup=path - Path to the backup file. Defaults to -state-out with the ".backup" extension. Disabled by setting to "-".

* -compact-warnings - If Terraform produces any warnings that are not accompanied by errors, show them in a more compact form that includes only the summary messages.

* -input=true - Ask for input for variables if not directly set.

* -lock=true - Lock the state file when locking is supported.

* -lock-timeout=0s - Duration to retry a state lock.

* -no-color - If specified, output won't contain any color.

* -parallelism=n - Limit the number of concurrent operation as Terraform walks the graph. Defaults to 10.

* -state=path - Path to read and write the state file to. Defaults to "terraform.tfstate". Ignored when remote state is used.

* -state-out=path - Path to write updated state file. By default, the -state path will be used. Ignored when remote state is used.

* -target=resource - A Resource Address to target. Operation will be limited to this resource and its dependencies. This flag can be used multiple times.

* -var 'foo=bar' - Set a variable in the Terraform configuration. This flag can be set multiple times. Variable values are interpreted as literal expressions in the Terraform language, so list and map values can be specified via this flag.

* -var-file=foo - Set variables in the Terraform configuration from a variable file. If a terraform.tfvars or any .auto.tfvars files are present in the current directory, they will be automatically loaded. terraform.tfvars is loaded first and the .auto.tfvars files after in alphabetical order. Any files specified by -var-file override any values set automatically from files in the working directory. This flag can be used multiple times.
