# Infrastructure as Code

* Managing infrastructure in a file or files.
* A resource in this instance is any piece of infrastructure in a given environment, such as a virtual machine, security group, network interface, etc.
* Easy Repeatable.
* Easily Readable.
* Opertional certaintly with terraform plan.
* Standardized Environment builds.
* Quickly provisoned development environment.
* Disaster Recovery.
* If your managed your virtual infrastructure’s through web interface.  The users haven’t adopted the use of infrastructure as code (IaC) through the use of tools like HashiCorp Terraform.
* “Day 0” code provisions and configures your initial infrastructure.
* “Day 1” refers to OS and application configurations you apply after you’ve initially built your infrastructure. i.e Ansible, Chef and Puppet.
* Standardizes workflows across different infrastructure providers (e.g., VMware, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
* IaC makes changes idempotent, consistent, repeatable, and predictable.
* This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code
